From great communication to outstanding practical skill he was able to identify the issue promptly and get to work!My issues are far from being a quick fix but Paul has got me through the first step to recovery that I will surely return to achieve.",

      "As a runner I have been suffering with several aches and pains, predominantly  my calves and ankles. Paul was excellent, focusing on all the areas Iâ€™ve had problems with. Just one session has made so much difference. The home visit is so convenient and Paul makes you feel at ease straight away. I would highly recommend, and will definitely be booking my next session soon",

      "I have been suffering with my back for many years and seen several people about it and got nowhere. I've had 2 sessions with paul, deep massages on my back and the right side of my body, i couldn't believe the improvements and movement to my body just after 2 sessions with Paul. I would highly recommend and I will be going back!",
